<p><b style="color: #2f8dcb">Siloz</b> was founded in 2007 as 'efaire', by <b>Zackery West</b> and co-founder (and sister), Lisa Evans, as an alternative to Craigslist.  That version had crowd-funding by selling items, but also permitted individual sellers (who sold items that did not benefit a silo) and non-profits (which could conceivable operate very large silos).  </p>

<p>In 2010, Benjamin Kaubisch came aboard as a co-founder of a newer iteration.  Sierk Arjen Beij and Alexander Black also made contributions to the first attempted build, which was exceedingly complex for the programming language chosen (Drupal).  It was not until the end of 2011 Gia Vinh Anh Pham, a UC Berkeley Ph.D. student and programmer, came aboard, that a from-scratch, custom, site was constructed, under Manager and CEO, <b>Zackery West</b>.</p>

<p><b style="color: #2f8dcb">Siloz</b>' possesses a great desire to help people to leverage latent resources in their community to do good, to make change on a regional basis.  We believe less is more, and we believe our motivations are transparent to our users.  We seek success, but proceed with the conviction of our principles, first.  We have no intention of selling out business or going public, perhaps ever.</p>
