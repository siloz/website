<b>Sellers</b>
<br><br>
Sellers are voluntary members of the community of a silo, and free to exit the silo (and pledge/donate items for another silo, or not at all) at their discretion.

<br><br>
Sellers are required to disclose all reasonable material details about a listed item, as the buyer is paying for the item, 'sight unseen'. A failure to properly represent an item may result in a refund by the site.
