	<li><b style="color: #2f8dcb">Siloz</b> offers tools for anybody who wants to actively help other people realize a dream of goodwill and/or contribute to the quality of the lives of others.

	<li><b style="color: #2f8dcb">Siloz</b> has set up checks and balances (including keeping personal silos invisible) to protect users and ensure fair play, but we ask that at all times you exercise skeptical judgment of any person representing him- or her-self as anything.

	<li>Sellers are voluntary members of the community of a silo, and free to exit the silo (and pledge/donate items for another silo, or not at all) at their discretion. 
	<li>Sellers are prohibited from donating (pledging or listing) items they do not lawfully own, and prevented from donating (pledging or listing) items they do not both control and have the ability to deliver to a seller.
