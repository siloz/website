				<p><?=SITE_NAME?> is much like an 'online church rummage sale', where people pledge the sale of items and remittance of donations to a silo's administrator (creator), in a fund-raising effort.  Every item listed on the site benefits some fund-raiser (called a 'silo').  In our initial (2011) version, no items are actually sold on the site, and no money is sent through the site.</p>

				<p>A silo can be for personal (wedding, birthday present or event, Bar Mitzvah, funeral, legal or medical costs, etc.), or a community fund-raiser (youth sports team, church, neighborhood association, etc.).</p>

				<p>Anybody can start a silo, invite social contacts (with Facebook or through email).  Members then pledge items.  A silo lasts for up to 30 days.  A person may run one silo every 4 months.  The site is entirely free.  There are no limits to the number of people who can join a silo, or a silo's particular fund-raising goal.</p>

				<p>Select the 'Create Silo' button at the top of the page.  Follow the prompts.</p>

				<p>Personal silos are not visible on the site and are not visible in an Internet search, and only items benefiting community silos indicate which silo they benefit.  These are security features.  Personal silos can be shared through their unique URL (web address).  This is a feature prevents someone, from, say, falsely claiming they have a child dying from cancer, and inviting strangers to pledge items or money. </p>

				<p><?=SITE_NAME?> uses transparency, checks and balances, and accountability to create a safe, effective, fun, fund-raising experience for personal and community causes alike.</p>

				<p>Select the 'Search Silos' button in the navigation bar on the home page.  You will see silos on a map, and in the grid on the left of the screen.  Hover over silos on a map for more information.  Select an object to be taken to a Silo's Detail Page.  On the Silo Detail Page, select 'Donate' or 'Sell for This Silo' and follow the prompts.  </p>

				<p>After you pledge an item or indicate that you will make a donation, you are free to sell your item any way you choose, or send your money to your silo administrator any way you choose.  You can sell your item on Ebay, Craigslist, or even a yard sale.  You can send your donation or pledged funds with PayPal, or with a Money Order.  </p>

				<p>When an item sells, you change the status of your item to 'item sold', or 'payment sent' as the case may be.  When the money is received by the silo administrator, he or she changes the status to 'payment received'.</p>

				<p>Since items are not for sale on the site, but only represented, it is up to silo members to keep the status of pledged items up-to-date.</p>

				<p>If you are selling an item online, it helps to list it (on Craigslist or Ebay), first.  Then you can provide a link to the listed item on <?=SITE_NAME?>.com.  Or, you re-build the pledge with a photo and copying/pasting text.</p>
